# SEVM - Setheum-Ethereum Virtual Machine:

The SEVM - The Setheum EVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility layer that implements the EVM on Setheum and bridges to Ethereum that opens the ground for interoperability between Ethereum and Setheum.
The SEVM lets developers onboard, deploy or migrate their Ethereum Solidity Smart Contracts on Setheum seamlessly with little to no change in their code.
The SetheumEVM has a beautiful library of developer tools that let developers deploy, manageand interact with their smart contracts and upgradable smart contracts on the S-EVM with popular and well documented tools like Truffle, MetaMask, et al.
The Setters.JS is the Web3 Ethers.JS compatibility library for the Setheum EVM, to let users access the Setheumand the EVM both with a single wallet without having to use two separate wallets for compatibility.
