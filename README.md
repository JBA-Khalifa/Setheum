# Introduction

Setheum is founded and initiated and fascilitated by Muhammad-Jibril B.A. who founded Setheum Labs, Setheum Foundation to steward and support the development and advancement of the Network, its ecosystem and its community to foster the development and adoption of decentralised finance by building and supporting cross-chain open finance infrastructure such as the SERP (Setheum Elastic Reserve Protocol) stablecoin system, the SetMint stablecoin minting system and Setheum's built-in payment system SetPay(CashDrops) that lets traders and transactors claim cashback (what we call CashDrop) on their transactions to speak of a few. 
Setheum also deploys Advanced Incentivization mechanisms and economic models modeled under the Jurisdiction of Islamic Finance.

## Core Products - Unique to Setheum (VP)

### The Tokens/Currencies

#### The Main Coins - Tokens

```bash
SETHEUM("Setheum", 12) = 1, // Staking Token and Governance Token - Native token (Native Currency)
DNAR("Serp Dinar", 12) = 1, // SERP Reserve Asset
```

#### The Setter - SERP Basket Stablecoin

```bash
SETR("Setter", 12) = 2, // SetMint Reserve Asset, stablecoin basket currency.
```

#### The SetCurrencies - SERP Stablecoins

```bash
SETUSD("SetDollar", 12) = 3,
SETEUR("SetEuro", 12) = 4,
```

1. The Setter - The Setter is a basket currency pegged to the Top 10 Strongest and most valuable currencies. It serves as the medium of Exchange and the Defacto stablecoin of the Setheum Ecosystem. All other Setheum system stablecoins orbit around the Setter (SETR) and the SetMint for minting Setheum Currencies (system stablecoins) accepts only the Setter as the Minting Reserve Asset. Only with the Setter (SETR) can a user participate in the DNAR Auctions to stabilize the price of the Setter, while the Setter is Auctioned to stabilize the price of all the other SettCurrencies (system stablecoins). It's the star that brightens many planets - 10 to be exact

2. [The SERP](./lib-serp) - The SERP (Setheum Elastic Reserve Protocol) is algorithmically responsible for stabilizing the prices of the Setheum Stable Currencies. No human interferrance is needed for this, it's all algorithmically handled by the SERP. The SERP is the backbone of Setheum, it is based on my TES (Token Elasticity of Supply) algorithm based on PES (Price Elasticity of Supply) such that the demand curve or price of a currency determines the supply serping point, meaning the supply curve of a SetCurrency will be adjusted according to the demand curve of that specific SetCurrency. The result will be burning or minting an amount equivalent to the serping point produced by the SERP-TES, the burning amount will be bought back by the SERP automatically through the built-in-DEX and the bought amount will be burnt to meet the satisfaction of the demand curve to prop the price back up to its peg, the opposite is done to lower the price of an under-supplied currency that is on demand and above its peg on the demand curve, for this the mint amount is divided into receipients including the SetPayTreasury where CashDrops are deposited for users to claim, the System Treasury under Governance, the Charity Fund stewarded by the Setheum Foundation, and the WelfareTreasury, more on the Welfare Treasury below.

	In The SERP and Setheum lingua, I coined these terms:
	* serp: to increase or decrease the supply of a Setheum stable Currency at its serping point in the curve, on either the x or y axis, the negative or the positive.
	* serpup: to increase the supply of a Setheum stablecurrency at its serping point.
	* serpdown: to decrease the supply of a Setheum stablecurrency at its serping point.

3. The CashDrops - The CashDrops that are dispatched by the SERP to the claimants (transactors/transactions that claim cashdrops). Whoever transacts witha SetCurrency (Setheum Stable Currency), they can toggle on claim cashdrop to get a cashback of 1% of the amount they transferred/sent, this amount is only cashdropped if the CashDropPool has enough funds to cover that amount. The funds in the CashDropPool are provided by the SERP through SerpUps and through SerpTransactionFees. SerpTransactionFees are 0.2% transaction fees that are paid on SetCurrency transactions, these funds are then transferred by the system to the SERP'S CashDropPool for CashDrops ready to be claimed.

4. The EFE and EFFECTs - The EFE is the

5. [The SetMint](./lib-serml/setmint) - The Setmint is partly inspired by the Maker Protocol (MakerDAO), except that SetMint is on a very different principle of Setheum that ought not to be violated.
SetMint is not a CDP but quite similar, as users can hold, authorize & transfer positions, users can reserve the Setter (SETR) to mint any SetCurrency of their choice without the need for over-collateralization, debt, interest rates, liquidation, or even stability fees. The stability of the Currencies is handles by the SERP, and the the Setter used as the reserve currency is also a SetCurrency (Setheum System Stablecoin) therefore eliminating position volatility and the risk of liquidation as all risk parameters have been eliminated with the Setter and Setheum's strong principle on the matters of the SetMint and Setheum's Monetary Policy.
This is one of the reasons I see Setheum as one of the most Sophisticated Advanced Economic Systems yet so simple, easy to use and understand, and even easier to get started.

6. [The SEVM](./lib-serml/evm) - The Setheum EVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility layer that implements the EVM on Setheum and bridges to Ethereum that opens the ground for interoperability between Ethereum and Setheum.
The SEVM lets developers onboard, deploy or migrate their Ethereum Solidity Smart Contracts on Setheum seamlessly with little to no change in their code.
The SetheumEVM has a beautiful library of developer tools that let developers deploy, manageand interact with their smart contracts and upgradable smart contracts on the S-EVM with popular and well documented tools like Truffle, MetaMask, et al.
The Setters.JS is the Web3 Ethers.JS compatibility library for the Setheum EVM, to let users access the Setheumand the EVM both with a single wallet without having to use two separate wallets for compatibility.

# Getting Started 

This project contains some configuration files to help get started :hammer_and_wrench:

### Rust Setup

Follow the [Rust setup instructions](./doc/rust-setup.md) before using the included Makefile to
build the Setheum node.

## Initialisation

Install Rust:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Make sure you have `submodule.recurse` set to true to configure submodule.

```bash
git config --global submodule.recurse true
```

Install required tools and install git hooks:

```bash
./scripts/init.sh submodule build-full
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Clone
To clone the repo with its submodules run:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Setheum-Labs/Setheum
```

### Rust Setup

If you donâ€™t have Rust already, you can install it with:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

You can install developer tools on Ubuntu 20.04 with:
```bash
sudo apt install make clang pkg-config libssl-dev build-essential
```

You can install the latest Rust toolchain with:
```bash
make init
```

### Start a development node

The `make run` command will launch a temporary node and its state will be discarded after you terminate the process.
```bash
make run
```

### Run a persistent single-node chain

Use the following command to build the node without launching it:

```bash
make build
```

This command will start the single-node development chain with persistent state:

```bash
./target/release/setheum-node --dev
```

Purge the development chain's state:

```bash
./target/release/setheum-node purge-chain --dev
```

Start the development chain with detailed logging:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/setheum-node -lruntime=debug --dev
```

### Run tests

```bash
make test
```

### Run benchmarks

Run runtime benchmark tests:
```bash
make bench
```

Run module benchmark tests:
```bash
cargo test -p module-poc --all-features
```

Run the module benchmarks and generate the weights file:
```
./target/release/setheum-node benchmark \
    --chain=dev \
    --steps=50 \
    --repeat=20 \
    --pallet=module_poc \
    --extrinsic='*'  \
    --execution=wasm \
    --wasm-execution=compiled \
    --heap-pages=4096 \
    --output=./lib-serml/poc/src/weights.rs
```

### Run in debugger

```bash
make debug
```

### Embedded docs

Once the project has been built, the following command can be used to explore all parameters and subcommands:

```bash
./target/release/setheum-node -h
```

### Release builds

To list all available release builds run:
```bash
git tag
```

To create a corresponding production build, first checkout the tag:
```bash
git checkout testnet-1
```

Then run this command to install appropriate compiler version and produce a binary.
```bash
make release
```

### On-Chain upgrade builds

Build the wasm runtime with:
```bash
make wasm
```

### Generate Tokens & Predeploy Contracts - SetheumEVM (SEVM)

```bash
./scripts/generate-tokens-and-predeploy-contracts.sh
```

__Note:__ All build commands with `SKIP_WASM_BUILD` are designed for local development purposes and hence have the `SKIP_WASM_BUILD` enabled to speed up build time and use `--execution native` to only run use native execution mode.

## 6. Bench Bot

Bench bot can take care of syncing branch with `master` and generating WeightInfos for module or runtime.

### Generate module weights

Comment on a PR `/bench runtime module <setheum_name>` i.e.: `serp_prices`

Bench bot will do the benchmarking, generate `weights.rs` file push changes into your branch.
